# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- **Test & Lint**: `npm test` - Runs ESLint and test suite with coverage (requires coverage threshold)
- **Lint Only**: `npx eslint` - Run ESLint using neostandard configuration
- **Coverage Check**: Tests require coverage check to pass via borp

## Architecture Overview

This is an Undici interceptor that enables routing HTTP requests to worker threads with load balancing and mesh networking capabilities.

### Core Components

1. **ThreadInterceptor** (`index.js:7-10`) - Main entry point that creates and coordinates the system
2. **Interceptor** (`lib/interceptor.js`) - Handles domain matching and request routing decisions
3. **Coordinator** (`lib/coordinator.js`) - Manages routes and MessageChannel communication between threads
4. **RoundRobin** (`lib/roundrobin.js`) - Implements load balancing across worker threads for same hostname
5. **Wire** (`lib/wire.js`) - Configures worker threads to receive and process requests

### Key Architecture Patterns

- **Domain-based Routing**: Requests are routed based on hostname matching a configured domain suffix (e.g., `.local`)
- **Round-robin Load Balancing**: Multiple workers can serve the same hostname with automatic load distribution
- **Mesh Networking**: All worker threads can communicate with each other via MessageChannels
- **Zero-copy Streaming**: Large payloads use MessagePort transfers to avoid memory copying

### Request Flow

1. Client makes request to `hostname.domain` (e.g., `api.local`)
2. Interceptor checks if hostname ends with configured domain
3. If matched, finds route and selects next worker via round-robin
4. Creates MessageChannel and sends serialized request to worker
5. Worker processes request (either locally or via network proxy)
6. Response is sent back through MessageChannel to client

### Worker Configuration

Workers use `wire()` function from `index.js:12-15` to:
- Accept either HTTP server instances or network URLs as targets
- Configure hooks for request/response lifecycle
- Handle graceful shutdown via `interceptor.close()`

### Testing Framework

- Uses `borp` test runner with coverage requirements
- Tests located in `test/` directory with comprehensive fixture support
- ESLint configured via `neostandard` for code quality
